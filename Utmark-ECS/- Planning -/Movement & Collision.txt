When expanding on the "Collision and Movement" point, it is important to break each of the two components down into multiple tasks, and from these tasks, 
create relevant Kanban/Scrum cards. Here’s a detailed breakdown with potential architecture decisions and Kanban/Scrum cards for each task.


Collision System

Architecture

    Collision Detection: 
        Implement an efficient way to detect collisions between entities and between entities and the environment.
    Collision Resolution: 
        After detecting a collision, resolve it correctly to ensure that entities don’t overlap or pass through each other.
    Collision Response: 
        Define how entities should respond when a collision occurs, such as taking damage, getting pushed back, etc.

Kanban/Scrum Cards

    Card 1: Implement basic AABB collision detection between entities.
        Description: Develop a system to detect axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) collisions between entities.
        Acceptance Criteria: Entities should be able to detect if they are in contact with each other.

    Card 2: Implement tile-based collision detection with the environment.
        Description: Develop a system to handle collisions between entities and the tile-based environment, preventing entities from passing through walls or obstacles.
        Acceptance Criteria: Entities should not be able to move through non-walkable tiles.

    Card 3: Implement collision response and resolution.
        Description: After a collision is detected, resolve it and define how entities will respond.
        Acceptance Criteria: Entities should respond appropriately to collisions, e.g., by taking damage, being pushed back, etc.


Movement System

Architecture

    Movement Calculation: 
        Calculate new positions for entities based on their velocities, inputs, and any other relevant factors.
    Position Update: 
        Update the entities’ positions in the world and inform other systems about these changes, e.g., rendering system, collision system.
    Velocity Management: 
        Manage and update the velocities of entities, possibly due to acceleration, deceleration, or external forces.

Kanban/Scrum Cards

    Card 4: Implement basic movement calculations.
        Description: Develop logic to calculate new positions for entities based on their current positions, velocities, and inputs.
        Acceptance Criteria: Entities should move correctly based on their velocities and user input, where applicable.

    Card 5: Implement position updates in the entity component system.
        Description: Ensure that the new positions calculated by the movement system are updated in the entity component system and are reflected in the game world.
        Acceptance Criteria: Changes in entity positions should be visible in the game world and should be accessible by other systems.

    Card 6: Implement velocity management.
        Description: Develop logic to manage and update entity velocities based on acceleration, deceleration, external forces, etc.
        Acceptance Criteria: Entity velocities should be correctly modified by various factors, resulting in accurate and realistic movement.

    Card 7: Refine movement and collision interaction.
        Description: Ensure that the interaction between the movement and collision systems is smooth and error-free.
        Acceptance Criteria: Entity movement should be fluid, and collisions should be detected and resolved accurately and efficiently.

Sprint Planning

    Sprint Goal: 
        To have a functional movement system with accurate collision detection and resolution for entities and the environment.
    Sprint Backlog: 
        Include Cards 1-7 in the sprint backlog.
    Definition of Done: 
        All cards are completed with their acceptance criteria met, code is reviewed and tested, and any discovered bugs are fixed.
